# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Basic-Architecture
There has been massive interest in recent years for once special skills known as Deep Learning in the IT industry. Deep learning comprises of methodologies influenced by the operation of the human brain or the neural networks.

These structures are called as Neural Networks. It teaches the computer to do what naturally comes to humans. Deep learning, there are several types of models such as the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Autoencoders, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Reinforcement Learning. But there has been one particular model that has contributed a lot in the field of computer vision and image analysis which is the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or the ConvNets.

CNNs are a class of Deep Neural Networks that can recognize and classify particular features from images and are widely used for analyzing visual images. Their applications range from image and video recognition, image classification, medical image analysis, computer vision and natural language processing. 

The term ‘Convolution” in CNN denotes the mathematical function of convolution which is a special kind of linear operation wherein two functions are multiplied to produce a third function which expresses how the shape of one function is modified by the other. In simple terms, two images which can be represented as matrices are multiplied to give an output that is used to extract features from the image.

There are two main parts to a CNN architecture
- A convolution tool that separates and identifies the various features of the image for analysis in a process called as Feature Extraction
- A fully connected layer that utilizes the output from the convolution process and predicts the class of the image based on the features extracted in previous stages.
